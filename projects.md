## FreeSurfer and the Common Workflow Language

The Common Workflow Language (CWL) is a specification for describing analysis workflows and tools in a way that makes them portable and scalable across a variety of software and hardware environments.  This project aims to specify FreeSurfer's recon-all stream in the common workflow language.  What is the best way to go about this and what does this enable?
