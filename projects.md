## Realtime visualization/analysis of BOLD data

Realtime fmri paradigms require a mechanism to stream BOLD data from the MR scanner to an external computer.  Given such a mechanism, what else is possible?  What other monitoring, visualization, or realtime paradigm can this mechanism enable?

## FreeSurfer and the Common Workflow Language

The Common Workflow Language (CWL) is a specification for describing analysis workflows and tools in a way that makes them portable and scalable across a variety of software and hardware environments.  This project aims to specify FreeSurfer's recon-all stream in the common workflow language.  What is the best way to go about this and what does this enable?
